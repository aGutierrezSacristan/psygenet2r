abstract = {PsyGeNET (Psychiatric disorders and Genes association NETwork) is a knowledge platform for the exploratory analysis of psychiatric diseases and their associated genes. PsyGeNET is composed of a database and a web interface supporting data search, visualization, filtering and sharing. PsyGeNET integrates information from DisGeNET and data extracted from the literature by text mining, which has been curated by domain experts. It currently contains 2642 associations between 1271 genes and 37 psychiatric disease concepts. In its first release, PsyGeNET is focused on three psychiatric disorders: major depression, alcohol and cocaine use disorders. PsyGeNET represents a comprehensive, open access resource for the analysis of the molecular mechanisms underpinning psychiatric disorders and their comorbidities. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION The PysGeNET platform is freely available at http://www.psygenet.org/. The PsyGeNET database is made available under the Open Database License (http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1.0/). CONTACT lfurlong@imim.es SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},
